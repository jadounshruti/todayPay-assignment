# Quiz App ðŸŽ‰

A simple and responsive Quiz App built with **React**, **React Router**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The app loads questions (from a local JSON file or API), lets users answer them one by one, provides instant red/green feedback on answers, and finally shows a results summary with score and the option to restart.
